**Robo-Advisor for personal finance**

This project is a prototype of an AI-driven Robo Advisor for Personal Finance, implemented as a web application using Streamlit and the power of Deep Learning (MLPClassifier).

It analyzes a user's detailed income and monthly spending habits (rent, groceries, entertainment, etc.) to predict their most probable Financial Profile (e.g., Stable Professional Saver, Optimized Student Saver).

The core function is to leverage machine learning to move beyond generic advice. By classifying the user into a specific profile, the app delivers a highly personalized, strategic Savings & Investment Action Plan tailored to that group's typical spending patterns, savings potential, and financial goals.
