**Robo-Advisor for personal finance**
This project is a prototype of an AI-driven robo-advisor implemented as a web application using Streamlit and Scikit-learn. It analyzes a user's financial and demographic profile to predict their most probable financial life stage (Occupation) and delivers highly personalized, strategic financial advice.
The core function is to leverage machine learning to move beyond generic advice. By classifying the user into a specific profile (e.g., Student, Professional, Retired), the app provides strategies tailored to that group's typical risk tolerance, time horizon, and income stability.
